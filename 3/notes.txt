-ignoring routes - (folder name)

-dynamic routes - eg if we have 1000 users,
it is not correct to create 1000 folders for each user,
[folder name]
'use client' on top
dynamic routes provide {params} object
{param.foldername} -> to retreive the value of endpoint 

-Catch all Routes -> /project/mern/expense-tracker/user1
used to capture all routes
[...foldername]
'use client' on top 
{params} object store captured endpoints
{params.foldername} -> foldername is an arrays for all routes

-file not found -> create a file not-found.js inside app dir
