fetch data using client components

fetch data using server components -> cant use useState and useEffect in server
we use async function to perform operations, console.log displays results in the terminal and not in browser console

backend development -> GET method
to create backend create api folder, specify endpoints, filename should be route.js
functions should be named as GET()
dynamic routes in backend -> [foldername]
